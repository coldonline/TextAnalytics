0	King Julius	['Review #800', 'Another incredible NE-style IPA from the always-amazing Tree House. If this one was disappointing at all, it’s only because it didn’t seem so extraordinary as to be one of the top 3 NE IPAs ever as rated on BA - but this was still an amazing brew nonetheless. Maybe I waited a little too long with this one - canned date 7/29/19, but I had wanted to wait to make this review #800. Looks wonderful, pours a nice, hazy orange-pale yellow color with some nice fluffy white head and glorious thick wide rings of lingering lacing that stayed throughout. Smells of very ripe fruit with food hoppiness - pineapple, guava, tangerine, mango, melon, grapefruit and passionfruit. Some nice aromas of malt, creamy vanilla, bread and then some more faint floral and dank notes in the background. Taste follows the nose, extremely well balanced and with good depth and complexity. Again a little dankness towards the finish especially as the beer warmed. Very well hidden higher ABV. Smooth, luscious, slightly sticky, fairly soft mouthfeel that coated the palate and was very juicy and easy to enjoy. Good amount of carbonation. I thoroughly enjoyed this one, just wish it could have had a little more power behind the bitter hops in order to tip the scales versus the solid malt backbone.']	4.5
1	King Julius	['Slightly orange and cloudy with a creamy slightly amber head. Totally opaque. Juicy fruit salad aroma. Flavor is straight orange with faint tropical notes. No bitterness whatsoever. Very clean, smooth, and easygoing. Would never know this is 8.3. Really delicious beer, though I prefer a little more depth and boldness. It’s a top-end beer to enjoy with your wife!']	4.28
2	King Julius	['A: Turbid gold/yellow with thick head and thick foamy lacing.\nN: Loads of juice/tropical, fresh citrus, reminds me a fresh cut fruit.\nT: Follows the nose, big tropical hit with clean citrus, some malt and biscuit notes.\nM: Creamy, smooth, soft, and low bite.\nO: One of the best NEIPA I have had so far, this is the benchmark for others to hit. FANTASTIC STUFF']	4.82
3	King Julius	"[""16oz can, Tree House snifter glass. Hazy golden orange body, bit of a coppery hue, one finger frothy white head, good retention. Rings of lacing. Smell is overripe oranges, citrus and grapefruit; mildly sweet grainy malt with a touch of white sugar. A bit of yeast esters giving off a bit of fruitiness. Definitely a Julius based beer both on the smell and palate. The palate brings a nice sweet orange and citrus presence, light herbal and resin, grapefruit as well. It's pretty similar to Julius with the malt and hops both amplified a bit. Not too sweet, but not too dry or resinous either. I think it compares similarly to Julius, and of course the mouthfeel is perfect- soft, creamy carbonation, medium body, easy to drink with a nice juicy finish. Overall- for what it takes to get, it's not really worth it over regular Julius- which when it's on, will be on par with all the best NE IPAs out there- but it is an interesting take and/or evolution of the beer.""]"	4.44
4	King Julius	['Appearance - pours thick turbid dark orange with a huge orange white head excellent retention. Tons of sticky lacing.', 'Aroma - Nose is sweet candied orange, pineapple, citrus peel, mango strong overly ripe fruit.', 'Taste - Big peach, pineapple, wet hops, citrus peel and grapefruit. Big flavors balanced sweet and bitter.', 'Feel - Medium bodied soft really creamy, little hop burn, alcohol is very well hidden.', 'Overall - Pretty impressive big hop flavors huge citrus very smooth and creamy nose is insane.']	4.83
5	King Julius	['16oz can. Pours a turbid bright yellowish orange with an inch of head. Lots of lacing. Smells like a tropical fruit smoothie. Orange, mango, berries, pineapple and vanilla ice cream. Tastes like a creamsicle along with some mango, pineapple, peach and a bit of grapefruit. Peaches and cream finish with some bitter citrus peel. Soft with lots of carbonation and an oily mouthfeel. Pretty noticeable alcohol presence.']	4.45

Finger of cloud and remain sometime.\nS:Strong Mango, tropical fruits aromas emitted immediately after open the can !\nT:Strong fruits notes as well as very comfortable level of bitterness.

7	King Julius	"[""Absolutely magical! Hazy, gold pour, luscious white foam head, both citrus and tropical fruit flavors dancing in your mouth, and one of the longest, deepest and ever-changing aftertaste that you'll ever find in a beer. It has a sterling reputation, and earns it with every sip.""]"	5
8	King Julius	['King Julius, canned 07/26/19.', 'Look: Pours a hazey light gold color. Pillowy head with very compact bubbles.', 'Smell: Smells intensely of sweet overripe orange (almost like orange marmalade) and mango smoothie with some grapefruit. There are also notes of peach and papaya and pine/resin. You can definitely smell the booziness, which is a bit unusual for a TH beer. Very nice and complex smell!', 'Taste: Amazingly balanced. Up front, you get hit with orange and mango smoothie (and other fruit) that you get on the nose. Judging from the smell, you may think it would be more bitter than it actually is. The bitterness on the back-end is just enough to get you coming back for more, but does not hang around, and is accompanied with another hit of fruit. As the beer warms up, the bitterness definitely comes out a bit more.', 'Feel: The mouthfeel on this beer is impossibly soft and smooth.', 'Overall: This is a perfectly balanced and well-designed IPA; not overwhelmingly hoppy or too sweet, and just enough bitterness to keep you coming back. Balanced all the way through. It really is Julius taken up a notch. It’s better than JJJulius as well. I haven’t had King JJJulius, so cant speak to that comparison yet.', 'Lives up to the hype!']	4.94
9	King Julius	['After relishing the true king of beers (Heady) i was in the same position as many, somewhat depressed I had peaked too soon. The. I went to Tree house and waited on line for Julius and many of his friends. The second I poured the Julius into my mouth I realized there was hope, it was legit and I just knew King Julius was going to be epic. Unfortunately it wasn’t available when I was there and I had to wait what felt like forever. A week later my buddy was in line and they announced a limited number of king Julius cans would be available. Three hours later I’m opening a can of heaven and the True King was born! The absolute smoothest DIPA on the planet, it’s like mixing a wicked NE DIPA with a cream sickle with some magic dust sprinkled in. Never a bad moment as it settles on your pallate, unfreakingbelievable!']	5

11	King Julius	['The King in the North. Take Julius and crank it up a few notches on the flavor profile. Where Julius shines, KJ shines just a bit brighter. The smell is intoxicating and amazing. Immediately after opening the can the room is bursting with tropical hops. The term orange creamsicle and mango smoothie are apt descriptions by them.']	4.84
12	King Julius	"[""Pours an opaque white-orange with two fingers of white foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is tangerine, papaya, mango, nectarine and orange, with a very dense, bountiful tropical fruit make-up. Flavor profile is tangerine, papaya, mango, nectarine, orange and mandarin orange with smooth and dynamic playfulness between tropical fruits. It's dense and flavorful, without ever coming across ultra-sugary or sweet. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a soft and pillowy texture that welcomes the tongue. Overall, hearty tropical fruits with a splendid sweetness meets pillowy soft textures for a delightful brew."", 'Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 16oz can.']"	4.75
13	King Julius	['Big thanks to Stofko1992 for sharing this one with me! The King pours out as a hazy orange color with a nice white head on top. Decent retention and scattered lacing. Notes of orange creamsicle and subtle pine on the nose. The taste has a piney resin punch up front that fades into a silky orange vanilla cream finish. The feel is smooth and kind of lingers for awhile which is nice. Overall it’s a solid beer and was great to finally try it.']	4.43
14	King Julius	['It’s not the prettiest beer in the world.. looks like muddy pineapple juice. Hop sediment gets caught in the tight head. Smells like you plunged your head into freshly crushed hops. Crazy, pithy citrus aromas, pineapple and vanilla.']	4.33
15	King Julius	"[""I am lucky enough to live within driving distance of Treehouse, so this is actually not a hard beer for me to enjoy. If you know that hoppy-grape bubblegum smell that hits you when you approach the Treehouse doors, that's what this smells like."", ""I am not a fan of juicy IPA ... I prefer the citrus/pine/resin style. Oddly, I'd leave a Julius if offered one however King Julius isn't as juice forward which is probably why I love it. It lacks that sweet pineapple, pulpy orange juice flavor of a juicy IPA and adds some piney lemon. It's like a hazy version of Sip of Sunshine."", 'I love everything about this beer, from the smell to the taste. I just wish it packed a stronger buzz factor, for some reason after 2 I am not feeling much whereas one or two cans of many Treehouse offerings make me feel light and fuzzy. Usually there is a 2-4 can limit so even those who live close by to TH will ration this stuff. This to me is what a great IPA is.']"	5

17	King Julius	['Sampling a cellar temp 16 oz can poured into my snifter. The beer pours a cloudy orange color with a bright white bleached head of 1 cm that foams up even with a gentle pour. The foam fades away to a sturdy surface layer soon after the pour. There is some windowpane lacing on the sides of my glass after each sip.\nThe aroma is fairly bold and is expected for the style and beer. Lots of citrusy notes with orange and tangerine notes.\nThe first sip reveals a fairly light creamy textured body with fine yet slightly prickly carbonation. Easy drinking brew so far.\nFlavor is citrus again, with orange and some mango notes mixing again. I also get a little bit of grapefruit rind bitterness on the finish. There is no hint of any booze and the beer is very easy to drink. Im glad to have enjoyed this one and would recommend it to folks that are really into the NEIPA scene, but Im not sure Ill chase this one next time']	4.27
18	King Julius	['Tasted from can. Pours murky orange with thick orange head. Huge citrus and orange aroma. Super well balanced crushable IPA. Citrus flavors dominate. Goes down way too easy.']	4.89
19	King Julius	"[""Not to say it's bad in any way but when a beer has the hype this has I just felt let down. Smooth and good body but kind of had an over ripe fruit dankness to it that just didnt land great for me. Checked off the bucket list.""]"	3.9
20	King Julius	['Fully opaque maize-tan with a large fluffy white head settling to a persistent film and chunky collar.', 'Taste is orange and papaya with a tangy green hoppy zip, almost like mint. A hint of Nilla wafer leans in before a lightly sharp, acidic swallow.', 'The frothy body is round and full but quickly rushes into an overwhelmingly chewy, chalk dry finish.', 'Still good, but severely unbalanced. Regular Julius is much more enjoyable overall.']	4
21	King Julius	['Fresh can, Orange straw, fully hazed. Big fluffy head.\nAroma is big full force citrus. OJ and layers of fruit.\nFlavor is orange juice, citrus zest, fresh tropical hoppy fruit. Not crazy sweet, nice balance.\nSoft and smooth with moderate carbonation and medium body.\nMet my somewhat high expectations. Have had mixed feelings about some highly rated Tree House, but this was excellent']	4.6
22	King Julius	['Pours a deep gold with a close to full haze can see slightly through the edges of the beer. The aroma is a wonderful tropical citrus medley of candied orange peel, mango, peach and grapefruit. The flavor follows the nose with a burst of tropical citrus candy up front, thankfully not cloying, with a great piney, green resinous bitterness which makes for a great contrast to the candied tropical flavors. The mouthfeel is a light density and medium viscosity with a slightly astringent finish. Wonderful beer that I wish more people could experience without the hype, but thankfully it does a solid job of living up to it and I’m pumped I finally got to try it.']	4.63
23	King Julius	"[""Tasty yet predictable NEIPA... they're starting to all taste the same. This one has good aroma and flavor, not elite. Drinks a little muddy and yeasty but still quite enjoyable""]"	4.19
24	King Julius	['Very cloudy straw-orange appearance with slight white head. Aroma is a prominent grapefruit that is slightly tangy. Taste is also a prominent grapefruit with a tangy touch.']	4.75
